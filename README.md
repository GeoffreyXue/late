## Description

Meetings! Going up the industry ladder, you calendar is increasingly packed with different kinds of meetings. As you get deep into discussion, some meetings often run over time, leading to a cascading effect of being late. Typing up a response or a longer email may not be feasible if you're engaged in the discussion. At the end of the day, people sit in meeting rooms or on empty Zoom calls contemplating whether you're coming, leading to friction.

Late allows you to notify participants in your upcoming meeting that you're running late with a press of a widget, giving both you and those in the meeting some ease of mind. The anticipated event is configured via the app, which handles authenticating and authorizing you via Google One Tap.

Late prioritizes simplicity and speed above everything - get the app set up in as little as three clicks and send an email with one it does so by using Google One Tap's auto-login feature if there only exists on account to log in, and autoselecting your primary calendar upon login.

## Project Development

Develoed entirely in Android, using Google Calendar API and Google Gmail API.
